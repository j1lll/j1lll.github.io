## MATH 104: Applied Matrix Theory & Linear Algebra

This project demonstrates how when photos are filtered and edited, the underlying principles of matrix theory and linear algebra are applied in order to transform the image. Matrix operations, such as multiplication, addition, convolution, and averaging, are utilized to modify pixel values and create the desired visual effects. By leveraging the mathematical foundations of linear algebra, photo editors can achieve a wide range of creative enhancements and artistic transformations in their images.
